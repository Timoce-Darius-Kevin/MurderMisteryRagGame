# Game Idea

- The general idea is each game takes place in a location which holds some effect over the players. The game starts with all the players at a location. one of these players will be handled by the user, all the others by the AI. Each Player has an inventory with only one item within one player's inventory being the murder weapon, and that player being the murderer. Players will may move from room to room, and the user may talk to other players. The AI model will handle the actions and responses given by other players. If the AI model deems a response suspicious or the player stays in a room too long the suspicion meter will increase. The AI is not allowed under any circumstance to say what is the murder weapon or who is the murderer. Every turn, with each turn being an action decided by the user, and actions are to move to an available room, to wait in the current room to ask someone a question or to accuse someone to be a murderer, each AI player will take a 10% chance decision to move to another room.
